# Serverbuilder

A shell (Linux) application to build minecraft servers.

I did more then 100 commits on this resource.
I also made it a lite resource which means it wont use up that much disk space until you want to download a script.

# MinecraftMultiversion

Paperclip equipted with plugins to make it support every multiplayer version
MinecraftMultiversion supported 1.4.7 - 1.12.2
the paperclip.jar that the server uses is actually 1.11.2 and not 1.12.2
I used protocolsupport to support 1.4.7 - 1.11.2 and viaversion to support 1.11.2 - 1.12.2
The reason I made this is cause at the time I had about 20 running minecraft servers, then the latest minecraft came out...
When I switched out the main server jarfile most of the plugins stopped working, data got corrupted, and players couldnt join.
I also got news from devs saying it will take them months to update to the latest version of minecraft so i did something smart.
I DOWNGRADED! Even though the latest version of minecraft was stable I still dont consider it stable. 1.11.2 has been out for a while and plugins have adapted to it, so I desided to create Minecraft Multiversion.
This fixed all of my problems and added support for 1.12.2 and many versions later.

# ThermosServer

was a template for me to create modded servers with plugins (mainly 1.7.10)

it is a compact resource with most of the files being libraries for thermos.jar
I also added some spigot plugins and ThermosServer helped me think of creating PaperThermos.
Thermos is spigot and forge, my new project was multiversion forge and paperclip. I called this project PaperThermos.
Come to think of it all I did with PaperThermos is set up a jenkins project and put the decompiled paperclip.jar and thermos.jar in it.
