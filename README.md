# My goals

1. Make useful repositories.
2. Help others be better at coding.
3. Help organizations grow.
4. Learn 5+ computer languages.
5. Offer a variaty of projects.
6. Do 10+ commits daily on github

***I reached 1000 commits on Monday, January 29, 2018***

# Notice

I have ***reached 1000 commits on Monday, January 29, 2018*** and I have had 10 commits or more a day from Jan 1 2018 to febuary 9 2018. The reason it does not show up as this is cause one of best repositories called WebIDE was accidentally deleted. This mistake removed many of my recent commits.

> Note: This will not affect any of my code in WebIDE cause I had a backup of it and restored it IMMEDIATELY to the latest code.
